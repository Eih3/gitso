 Can you please update this documentation or point us in the right direction on these two details?

 There is no src directory within gitso_0.6_src.tar.bz2. There is a trunk directory which contains the hosts.txt file indicated however. 2. There is no file named makegitso.pl within gitso_0.6_src.tar.bz2. There are other files named makegitso.bat, makegitso.sh, and makegitso.nsi.

 It is just inside the gitso-0.6 directory for you.

 Run ./makegitso.sh
